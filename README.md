# HotDogClassifier
This is a joke project inspired by the TV show Silicon Valley. This notebook trains CNNs to classify if an image (of food) is of a hot dog or not.

Not really a novel idea but thought it'd be fun to just do. Doesn't have great accuracy (yet) but I don't have immediate plans of optimizing this.
